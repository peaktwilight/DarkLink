# DarkLink Framework - Academic Research Project

**DarkLink is a fork of the MicroC2 framework, building upon the original bachelor's thesis to provide improved functionality, front-end, OPSEC capabilities, and stability.**

**This thesis proposes the design of a lightweight C2 framework for penetration testing and red team operations, emphasizing stealth and a low system footprint. The framework utilizes covert communication, encryption and obfuscation to evade detection by security tools like EDR and IDS. Its effectiveness is evaluated in simulated environments, offering insights into evasion techniques and improving defensive strategies.**

## ⚠️ Known Limitations and Security Considerations

Developed under academic constraints (timeline, research focus, lab testing), this framework prioritizes proof-of-concept over production-ready security.

**Key Limitations:**
- Incomplete input validation.
- Basic error handling.
- Research-grade cryptographic implementations.
- Functionality-focused network security (not hardened).
- Basic authentication.
- Limited operational logging/monitoring.

**For Authorized Testing:**
- Use ONLY in isolated, air-gapped environments.
- Implement robust monitoring and logging.
- Secure explicit written authorization.
- Adhere to institutional research protocols.
- Coordinate with network/security teams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Go** (v1.23+ recommended)
- **Rust** (for agent builds)
- **Node.js & npm** (for web UI development, if you plan to modify frontend)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **MinGW-w64** (for cross-compiling Windows agents from Linux)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DarkLink.git
   cd DarkLink
   ```
2. **Build the server:**cd 
   ```sh
   cd server
   go build -o server ./cmd/server.go
   ```
3. **Build the agent (optionally use cargo strip to reduce compile build as much as possible):**
   ```sh
   cd ../agent
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. **Build the agent for Windows (from Linux):**
   - Install MinGW-w64:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
     ```
   - Ensure the import library for Iphlpapi is available and symlinked:
     ```sh
     sudo ln -sf /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libiphlpapi.a /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/libIphlpapi.a
     ```

### Running the Server
1. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   cd server
   ./server
   ```
2. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open your browser and go to: [https://localhost:8080/home/](https://localhost:8080/home/) (or the port you configured).

### Configuration
- Edit `server/config/settings.yaml` for server settings.
- Edit `agent/src/config.rs` or use environment variables for agent configuration.

### TLS certificates for using HTTPS
- Run the following in DarkLink/server/ to generate TLS certificates
    ```
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
    ```

### Creating Listeners
- Use the web UI to create HTTP Polling or SOCKS5 listeners.
- Agents will connect to the listener endpoints you configure.

### Building Payloads
- Use the Payload Generator in the web UI to generate agent binaries for your target OS/architecture.

### File Drop
- Upload and download files via the File Drop section in the web UI. Folder in codebase is /server/uploads/

## SOCKS5 Proxy Pivoting Setup (Multi-Hop Example)

DarkLink supports SOCKS5 proxy pivoting, including multi-hop scenarios. Below is a tested workflow for chaining agents and listeners to pivot through multiple internal hosts.

### Topology Example

```
Client <-> Server <-> VM1 <-> VM2
```

- **Server**: Runs DarkLink server and first agent (pivot entry point)
- **VM1**: First virtual machine, runs agent and acts as a SOCKS5 pivot server and uses a socks reverse proxy to connect to the c2 server
- **VM2**: second virtual machine, runs second agent

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. **Set Up Two SOCKS5 Listeners**

- In the DarkLink web UI, create two SOCKS5 listeners (everything apart from URI setup is free to be configured): 
  - **Listener 1**: For the agent on VM1 (e.g., port 8443)
  - **Listener 2**: For the agent on VM2 (e.g., port 8444)

#### 2. **Deploy and Configure Agents**

- **On VM1:**
  - Build an agent payload in the web UI, enabling SOCKS5 configuration.
  - Set the SOCKS5 proxy host/port to point to the DarkLink server and Listener 1.
  - Deploy and run the agent on VM1.
  - Start the SOCKS5 pivot on VM1:
    ```sh
    pivot_start 1080
    ```
  - (Optional) Start SSH if needed for port forwarding on c2 server and pivot server:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    ```
  - and connect on the agent side with
    ```sh
    ssh -N -D SOCKS5_PROXY_PORT ServerUsername@ServerIP
    ```

- **On VM2:**
  - Build a second agent payload, configuring it to use VM1 as its SOCKS5 proxy (host: 127.0.0.1, port: 1080).
  - Deploy and run the agent on VM2.
  - Start the SOCKS5 pivot on VM2:
    ```sh
    pivot_start 1081
    ```
  - SSH from VM2 to VM1 if needed:
    ```sh
    ssh -N -D VM1_PROXY_PORT Vm1Username@IPofVm1
    ```
